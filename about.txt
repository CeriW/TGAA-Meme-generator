Me: I need to study in order to advance my career in web development.
Also me: *spends all my time making 'The Great Ace Attorney' content*
Solution? This.

I am Ceri, a front end web developer in Devon, UK, although many people in the TGAA fandom will know me as CherryLestrade on Youtube, Twitter and Reddit. 

This meme generator was made by myself as a passion project in order to practice Javascript as well as learning a few new things along the way. I use Javascript often in my day job, but it is often simple things so I had a lot of fun creating something on this scale. It was built in raw HTML, CSS and Javascript, the headers are added using Jekyll (which frankly is probably overkill for a single page site, but I'd never used it before and wanted to try it out), and hosted on Github pages (again, something I'd never used before and am amazed how easy it is - I highly recommend).

I would sincerely love to see any memes you create with this. Do tag me on Reddit or Twitter if you share them!

More about 'The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles'
'The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles' is a two part visual novel game by Capcom, who own the rights to all character, location and interface artwork on this page. It is honestly the best game I have ever played and I am obsessed with it despite the fact I finished it months ago.
